# Project Description

This project performs average filtering on an input image, aiming to reduce the effect of salt-and-pepper noise. By implementing an x86_32 assembly function callable from a C program, the technique replaces each pixel (8-bit unsigned integer) with the average value of its neighboring pixels, effectively smoothing out irregularly scattered white or black pixels. Through this process, the quality of the image is enhanced, resulting in a clearer representation of the original content.
